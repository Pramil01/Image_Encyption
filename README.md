# Image Encryption and Decryption Algorithm with Henon Map and SPN

## Introduction

This repository provides an overview of an image encryption and decryption algorithm that employs the Henon Map to generate a key and utilizes the Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) technique to secure image data. This algorithm ensures the confidentiality of image content and allows for decryption to retrieve the original image.

## Algorithm Overview

The algorithm consists of the following main steps:

1. **Key Generation with Henon Map**:
   - The Henon Map is used to generate a 2D matrix that forms the encryption key.
   - The x and y values generated by the Henon Map are XORed to create the key matrix.

2. **Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN)**:
   - A substitution box is created with unique values from 0 to 255, each occurring once. The logistic map is employed for this purpose.
   - The image data is substituted with values from the substitution box while simultaneously permutating the pixel values.
   - Rows are rotated based on their index, and columns are rotated similarly.

3. **Decryption**:
   - The decryption process is the reverse of the encryption process.
   - The key generated with the Henon Map is used along with reverse SPN operations, restoring the original image.

## Prerequisites

Before using this algorithm, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries for handling image data (OpenCV), mathematical operations, and data manipulation (Numpy).
