# Image Encryption and Decryption Algorithm with Henon Map and SNP

## Introduction

This repository provides an overview of an image encryption and decryption algorithm that employs the Henon Map to generate a key and utilizes the Substitution-Permutation Network (SNP) technique to secure image data. This algorithm ensures the confidentiality of image content and allows for decryption to retrieve the original image.

## Algorithm Overview

The algorithm consists of the following main steps:

1. **Key Generation with Henon Map**:
   - The Henon Map is used to generate a 2D matrix that forms the encryption key.
   - The x and y values generated by the Henon Map are XORed to create the key matrix.

2. **Substitution-Permutation Network (SNP)**:
   - A substitution box is created with unique values from 0 to 255, each occurring once. The logistic map is employed for this purpose.
   - The image data is substituted with values from the substitution box while simultaneously permutating the pixel values.
   - Rows are rotated based on their index, and columns are rotated similarly.

3. **Decryption**:
   - The decryption process is the reverse of the encryption process.
   - The key generated with the Henon Map is used to reverse the SNP operations, restoring the original image.

## Prerequisites

Before using this algorithm, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries for handling image data, mathematical operations, and data manipulation.

## Usage

To encrypt an image using this algorithm, follow these general steps:

1. Load the image.
2. Generate a key using the Henon Map.
3. Apply SNP encryption using the generated key.
4. Save the encrypted image.

To decrypt the image, use the same key generated from the Henon Map and reverse the SNP operations.

## Key Generation with Henon Map

The Henon Map is utilized to generate the encryption key. This key is formed by taking the bitwise XOR of the x and y values generated by the map. The key is crucial for both encryption and decryption processes.

## Substitution-Permutation Network (SNP)

The SNP involves the creation of a substitution box with unique values from 0 to 255, each occurring once, using the logistic map. Substitution and permutation operations are applied to the image data using the substitution box and row/column rotation.

## Decryption

Decryption is the reverse process of encryption. It involves using the Henon Map-generated key to reverse the SNP operations, returning the original image.
